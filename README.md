# Banking-Application  
This project is a simple simulation of a banking system.  
- It reads account details from a file and creates account objects based on the data.  
- The system provides a menu with various actions for the user to perform.  
- When the application is closed, it updates the original file with any changes.  
- The account data is stored in a local `.csv` file.  
- The project uses Object-Oriented Programming principles like encapsulation to protect data and modular design to break the system into smaller, manageable components.
